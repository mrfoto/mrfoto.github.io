About 2 months ago I was invited to speak at the [Pivorak Conference](https://pivorak.com/) in Lviv. I haven't been speaking in _a while_ so I told them I don't have any talks prepared. They said anything goes as long as it's _me_ giving it and it's at least _a bit_ technical.

I went on a run without headphones and thought about what I could give a talk on. I haven't been doing anything out of the ordinary like [flamegraphs](/talks/2017/05/03/crazy-weeks-of-march-and-april/) or [graph databases](/talks/2015/06/01/neo4j-for-rubyc-hipsters/) in a while. But I did tackle something interesting recently - **I started podcasting**[^1].

I haven't written a blog post about it, but if you follow me on any [social](https://instagram.com/miharekar) [network](https://twitter.com/miharekar), you saw that I'm promoting it **heavily**. It's called [Parallel Passion](https://www.parallelpassion.com/) and the gist is: _interview show with software developers about their hobbies_.

I used to go to conferences a lot and always preferred the _hallway track_ over the actual talks. You get to meet people _personally_ that way. I **love** that. Because I don’t care what JS framework is popular _this week_ or how Ruby 7 is going to be _70-times faster_. I care about **people**. I care about things they do when they’re **not** programming.

I never liked the stereotype of a programmer: _an overweight, pimply neck-bearded nerd living in a basement somewhere with at least four computer monitors_[^2]. Because **I** am not that guy. And to be honest I don’t know people like that. Maybe it’s selection bias but software engineers I hang out with are **real people**. They have _lives_ outside computers. They have _awesome hobbies_ like [car racing](https://www.parallelpassion.com/3), [sky diving](https://www.parallelpassion.com/5), [boxing](https://www.parallelpassion.com/2), [curling](https://www.parallelpassion.com/7), [surfing](https://www.parallelpassion.com/8), [illustrating children books](https://www.parallelpassion.com/15)[^3], [making car reviews](https://www.parallelpassion.com/17),…

So I wanted to **showcase that**. In one small part to burst the stereotype bubble, but even more so because I want one hour of uninterrupted time with interesting people. **One on one**. I **love** talking with people who are **passionate** about their hobbies. Because I know how passionate **I** get when someone is interested in mine. I get a spark in my eyes and I can talk for hours. About [running](/posts/2017/08/20/running-gear/), about [coffee](/posts/2016/04/26/in-quest-of-a-better-coffee/), about [stoicism](/posts/2018/09/02/journaling/),… and then it **hit me**.

**Why don’t I do a talk on that**? Everything I love talking about - a _string of lightning talks_ if you will. [Ben Orenstein](http://www.benorenstein.com/) did [something like that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9JXH7JPjR4) on RailConf 2013 and it remains one of the best talks I've ever seen. So I wrote down a list of topics I love talking about[^4]. Then I started thinking about _transitions_ from one topic to the next and _eliminating_ those that didn't make sense. You can’t go from _coffee_ to _stoicism_ for example. Then I started a Keynote[^5] document with every topic as a _main slide_ with a couple of _bullet points_. Then those _bullet points_ became separate _sub-slides_. And then it was Friday. **Time to fly**. When will I rehearse this? _Fuck_. I guess we’ll test it in production 😬

You can’t hear it _well_ in the recording but when I said “thank you” there was a **roar of applause** that hit me. This has **never** happened to me before. It felt **amazing**. And after the talk I could _barely get a drink_ - everyone wanted to **talk to me**. Everyone found at least one thing in my talk they connected with. So while it was definitely the **weirdest** talk I ever gave it was also the most **fun** to give and by far the most **well received**. Even now, after it was posted on YouTube, I'm still getting a ton of positive feedback and follow-up questions.

This proves my point - us, software developers, **are people too**. And it’s time the world knows it!

So go listen and **subscribe** to [**Parallel Passion**](https://www.parallelpassion.com/) and tell your friends to do so as well!
